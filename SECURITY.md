\# Security Policy



Reporting a Vulnerability

\- Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to: security@example.com. Include a clear description, affected endpoints, impact, and proof-of-concept steps or screenshots. PGP key to be added for encrypted reports in a later step. Response target: initial acknowledgment within 72 hours and status update within 5 business days.



Supported Environments (Sprint 0)

\- This project is in Sprint 0 bootstrap. No production systems or customer data are in scope yet. This policy exists to prepare for responsible disclosure as functionality is added.



Safe Harbor and Good Faith

\- Research conducted and reported consistent with this policy will be considered authorized, and no legal action will be pursued for good-faith testing within scope. Avoid data exfiltration or service disruption. Do not access other usersâ€™ data or personal information.



Scope (current)

\- Repository code, configuration templates, and documentation.

\- Excluded for now: any third-party services, cloud accounts, domains, or production infrastructure until explicitly listed in scope.



Out of Scope Examples

\- Social engineering, physical attacks, DDoS or volumetric attacks, spam, and reports of missing security headers without proven impact.



Coordinated Disclosure

\- Please allow a reasonable time for triage and remediation before any public disclosure. Public disclosure should be coordinated and simultaneous after a fix or mitigation is available.



Preferred Report Template

\- Summary of issue and impact

\- Affected files/paths or endpoints

\- Steps to reproduce (minimal, deterministic)

\- Screenshots or PoC

\- Suggested remediation (if any)



Credits

\- With permission, valid, novel reports may be acknowledged in release notes or a Hall of Fame in future.
